This is an simple example of a docking/redesign run using a bare
minimum of input flags.

type 'orient' for description of command line options

orient -b L,H -g A -D gofr_files/ -r interfacedefn 1I9R_prepped.pdb >& out &

---- files created:
distmtx_final -- residue-residue distance matrix
final.pdb -- last structure generated
final.xyz -- last structure generated
landscape.txt -- docking landscape data for plotting
minnrg_bin*.pdb -- lowest energy structure at each separation distance bin
minnrg.xyz -- minimum energy structure found
movie.xyz -- an xyz movie (of what?)
poses.txt -- (I forgot what this is)
resresmtx_final -- final residue-residue interaction energies
resresmtx_initial -- initial residue-residue interaction energies
runstats.txt -- run statistics
starting.pdb -- reduced representation of starting pdb structure

---- how to use the output

Look in 'landscape.txt', consider plotting it (gnuplot plotme.g).
Find the lowest energy bin (4th column), look at header of
minnrg_bin[bin#].pdb to confirm that it has the same energy.  In this
case, bins 14 and 15 have identical low energies of -18.05 kcal/mol.
That is your "best solution".  If you wanted to turn it into a design
for synthesis, first regenerate the full complex by fitting the full
antigen portion to this the antigen in this pdb file.  Once you have
the full complex, pass it through a repacking program like Rosetta
Design to get residue identities for the interface residues.
